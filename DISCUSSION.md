### Out of Scope Work

While this project includes much of the work I would include in an MVP for this task, there are improvements that I would include if given time.

For the purposes of this project, the nice to haves I did not perform are:

- Adding a Specialties table in database with specialty name and id
  - Linking the ids of a specialty to an advocate in place of the specialty names
  - Consuming the specialties on the frontend for search purposes
- Changing the id column in the db to use UUID
- Searching the db with multiple criteria
  - Also searching the db with multiple specialties
- CMS integration
  - Adding images for each advocate to an integrated CMS
